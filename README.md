# Airline Tweet Classification (an NLP playground)

Trained a language model on Kaggle's Airline Sentiment dataset, then used the encoder to make a sentiment classifier. 

WHAT'S NEW: I experimented with adding class weights due to the imbalanced classes, and got less misclassifications for the minority classes, which was cool.
